            What is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu?

        <p class="jj-para">
            Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, commonly known as BJJ, is a martial art and combat sport that originated in
            Brazil.

            self-defense, competition, and overall fitness. Unlike many traditional martial arts, BJJ empowers
            practitioners to overcome larger and stronger opponents using leverage, technique, and timing.

            against them rather than relying solely on brute force. It is based on the principles of maximum efficiency
            and mutual welfare, making it suitable for practitioners of all ages and abilities.
